# âš¾ Major League Baseball SQL

## Understanding the Schema

I have used the [Lahman baseball statistics database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) for this project. The database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2017.  It includes data from the two current leagues (American and National), four other "major" leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875.

The database is comprised of the following main tables:

	People - Player names, date of birth (DOB), and biographical info
	Batting - batting statistics
	Pitching - pitching statistics
	Fielding - fielding statistics
	
The main tables are supplemented by other, smaller tables.

## Queries

1. **Basics**
    1. In the `people` table, find the `namefirst`, `namelast` and `birthyear` for all players with weight greater than 300 pounds.
    2. Find the `namefirst`, `namelast` and `birthyear` of all players whose `namefirst` field contains a space.
    3. From the `people` table, group together players with the same `birthyear`, and report the `birthyear`, average `height`, and number of players for each `birthyear`. Order the results by `birthyear` in *ascending* order.
    4. Following the results of Part iii, now only include groups with an average height > `70`. Again order the results by `birthyear` in *ascending* order.


2. **Hall of Fame Schools**
    1. Find the `namefirst`, `namelast`, `playerid` and `yearid` of all people who were successfully inducted into the Hall of Fame in *descending* order of `yearid`.
    2. Find the people who were successfully inducted into the Hall of Fame and played in college at a school located in the state of California. For each person, return their `namefirst`, `namelast`, `playerid`, `schoolid`, and `yearid` in *descending* order of `yearid`. Break ties on `yearid` by `schoolid, playerid` (ascending). (For this question, `yearid` refers to the year of induction into the Hall of Fame).
    3. Find the `playerid`, `namefirst`, `namelast` and `schoolid` of all people who were successfully inducted into the Hall of Fame -- whether or not they played in college. Return people in *descending* order of `playerid`. Break ties on `playerid` by `schoolid` (ascending). (Note: `schoolid` will be `NULL` if they did not play in college.)


3. **[SaberMetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics)**
    1. Find the `playerid`, `namefirst`, `namelast`, `yearid` and single-year `slg` (Slugging Percentage) of the players with the 10 best annual Slugging Percentage recorded over all time. For statistical significance, only include players with more than 50 at-bats in the season. Order the results by `slg` descending, and break ties by `yearid, playerid` (ascending).
    2. Following the results from Part i, find the `playerid`, `namefirst`, `namelast` and `lslg` (Lifetime Slugging Percentage) for the players with the top 10 Lifetime Slugging Percentage. Note that the database only gives batting information broken down by year; you will need to convert to total information across all time (from the earliest date recorded up to the last date recorded) to compute `lslg`.
    3. Find the `namefirst`, `namelast` and Lifetime Slugging Percentage (`lslg`) of batters whose lifetime slugging percentage is higher than that of San Francisco favorite Willie Mays. You may include Willie Mays' playerid in your query (`mayswi01`), but you *may not* include his slugging percentage -- you should calculate that as part of the query. (Test your query by replacing `mayswi01` with the playerid of another player -- it should work for that player as well! We may do the same in the autograder.)


4. **Salaries**
    1. Find the `yearid`, min, max, average and standard deviation of all player salaries for each year recorded, ordered by `yearid` in *ascending* order.
    2. For salaries in 2016, compute a [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram). Divide the salary range into 10 equal bins from min to max, with `binid`s 0 through 9, and count the salaries in each bin. Return the `binid`, `low` and `high` values for each bin, as well as the number of salaries in each bin, with results sorted from smallest bin to largest.
    3. Now let's compute the Year-over-Year change in min, max and average player salary. For each year with recorded salaries after the first, return the `yearid`, `mindiff`, `maxdiff`, and `avgdiff` with respect to the previous year. Order the output by `yearid` in *ascending* order. (You should omit the very first year of recorded salaries from the result.)
    4. In 2001, the max salary went up by over $6 million. Write a query to find the players that had the max salary in 2000 and 2001. Return the `playerid`, `namefirst`, `namelast`, `salary` and `yearid` for those two years. If multiple players tied for the max salary in a year, return all of them.
    5. Each team has at least 1 All Star and may have multiple. For each team in the year 2016, give the `teamid` and `diffAvg` (the difference between the team's highest paid all-star's salary and the team's lowest paid all-star's salary). Order your final solution by `teamid`. NOTE: Due to some discrepancies in the database, please draw your team names from the All-Star table (so use allstarfull.teamid in the SELECT statement for this).
